/**
 * A button that knows by itself that its handler is still at work (from phototag's AsyncButton).
 *
 * NOT `disabled={busy}` AT EVERY CALLER: "busy" is the state of THE BUTTON, not of the screen;
 * kept outside, it is kept twenty times and forgotten in `finally` nineteen of them, and one flag
 * per screen greys out every button at once.
 *
 * WHAT IT DOES BY ITSELF:
 * - it is disabled while at work, so a second tap does not send a second request;
 * - it shows a spinner IN PLACE OF its icon, not beside it: the button keeps its width and its
 *   neighbours do not jump under the finger;
 * - it catches a failure and shows it — a warning sign, the reason in its title — instead of
 *   failing silently (a request that came back 500 used to look exactly like one not sent);
 * - it does not touch its state after it is gone: the answer may come when the button is not
 *   there any more.
 *
 * A synchronous handler does as well: awaiting a non-promise is legal, and such a button behaves
 * as a plain one.

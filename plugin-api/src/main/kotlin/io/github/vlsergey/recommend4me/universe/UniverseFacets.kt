/**
 * The facets the application gives every work of a content type with universes
 * ([ContentType.universes][io.github.vlsergey.recommend4me.contenttype.ContentType.universes]),
 * whichever site it is from: what a source names in its page decor or reads of the user's links.
 *
 * - [KIND]: whether the work is fan fiction ([FANFICTION]), an alternative history of our world
 *   ([ALTERNATIVE_HISTORY]) or a world of its own ([ORIGINAL]) — the one a source may say itself: a
 *   site's fandom "originals", its genre "fan fiction";
 * - [UNIVERSE]: the universes of the dictionary the work is fan fiction of — one or several; an
 *   alternative history and an original work have none;
 * - [CHARACTERS]: its main characters, of those universes;
 * - [PAIRINGS]: its pairings, each two of its characters ("pair:<character>|<character>", the two
 *   in the order of their keys).
 *
 * Of the last three the site gives none: the user links a work, the model works the rest out from
 * the line the site writes the characters and pairings in ([SourceSchema.universeLine][io.github.vlsergey.recommend4me.source.SourceSchema.universeLine]),
 * the tags, the description and the chapters.

/**
 * The rows a scorer learns from: the features of every rating ([x], a row each), its grade, the
 * work it is of and the item it is of. Two ratings of one work never fall into different folds and
 * are never put in order by their grades. Two items of one work — one book on two sites, linked by
 * the user — are the same work seen twice: compared, they are EQUAL, whatever their grades. Two
 * versions of one item are not compared at all: an update may make a game better.
 *
 * The first [grades].size rows are the ratings. The rows after them are the items of linked works
 * the user did not grade: the same work as the other items of it all the same, they are compared
 * to them as equals — and through them put in order with every other work. They are in every fit,
 * for they tell nothing of any grade.

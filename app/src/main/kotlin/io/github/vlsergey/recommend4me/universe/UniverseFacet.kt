/**
 * The facets the application gives every work of a content type with universes ([UniverseFacets]).
 * Their values are kept as the user's corrections of the work's source — the site has none — and
 * worked out by the model, as any facet's:
 *
 * - the kind — fan fiction, an alternative history, an original work — is the site's when it
 *   says, suggested otherwise;
 * - the universes are worked out of every universe of the dictionary for a work that is not known
 *   to have none, and given to it: the work's characters are chosen within them;
 * - the main characters are worked out of the characters of the work's universes and the original
 *   characters, the pairings of pairs of the work's characters — given to the work at once.
 *
 * All four are of the application's layer over the source: the user corrects them.

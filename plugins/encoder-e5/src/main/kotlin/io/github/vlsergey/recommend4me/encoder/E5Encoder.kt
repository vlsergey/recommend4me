/**
 * A MULTILINGUAL sentence encoder: intfloat/multilingual-e5-small as an ONNX graph, 384 numbers,
 * mean-pooled and of unit length. A Russian query and an English overview land in one space —
 * the English-only MiniLM it replaced turned every Russian query into nearly the same vector,
 * and the search answered every one of them with the same games.
 *
 * E5 IS TRAINED WITH PREFIXES: "query: " for what is searched for, "passage: " for what is
 * searched in. The texts of the games are passages; the search line is a query.
 *
 * LONG TEXTS ARE READ IN WINDOWS of [WINDOW] tokens (prefix included): every window is encoded
 * on its own, and the text's vector is their mean weighted by length, made unit again.
 * Attention costs the square of the length, so windows shorter than the model's 512 are cheaper.
